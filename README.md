# Mail Router IOC 

This is an IOC Event driven architecture. 
Much thanks to Inversify for Inversion of control and Dependency injection in this Typescript mailing router micro service. 

Used this article by Samuele Resca to get a basic IOC app up and running: https://medium.com/@samueleresca/inversion-of-control-and-dependency-injection-in-typescript-3040d568aabe Thank you! 

Grunt + Typescript Boilerplate created with this article by Brian Love: http://brianflove.com/2016/11/08/typescript-2-express-node/
Thank you Brian! 

## Install

Install the node packages via:

`$ npm install --save`

And then run the grunt task to compile the TypeScript:

`$ npm run grunt`

## Starting

To start the server run:

`$ npm start`

## Moving On From Here...

While testing use the following command to compile and then serve the application. 

`$ npm run rebuild`

To test the default get handler use the following curl command (Assuming curl is already installed).

`curl http://127.0.0.1:8080`
